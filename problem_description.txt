The City of Baltimore provides open access to city data including citations and 
associated fines (https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Financial/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m).  
Our customer wants every citation to be a story in Rally.  Manually obtain a CSV 
export containing all citations that occurred on July 4th, 2012.  Write a program 
that loads the CSV data, transforms the data, and creates a second CSV file that is ready for upload into Rally.  The rules for the data going into Rally are:



1.  The Rally Name field should contain the citation number

2.  The Rally Description field should contain the Description

3.  The Rally ViolationDate field should contain the date.  Rally dates are in ISO format

4.  The Rally PlanEstimate field should contain the amount of the fine. The PlanEstimate field is an integer field.

6.  The Rally LicenseExpiration field should contain the date of the license plateâ€™s expiration.

7.  The Rally Notes field should contain a bulleted list of the Make of car, the State the car is from (full text, not abbreviation), and the license plate number
