CSV file formatting considerations:

Fields are separated by commas and enclosed in quotes if they contain commas or quotes
Embedded quotes in your input data are doubled
Embedded spaces do not require surrounding quotes
There is no comma following the last field on the line
Null fields are represented by two consecutive commas
Leading and trailing spaces on fields—even inside quotes—are ignored
File must normally end with a single CrLf (Carriage return, Line Feed or both)
The length of the path to your CSV file may not exceed 255 characters
Both Windows and non-Windows file browsing are supported
